the following is an installation guide under Windows7


 install VisualHaskell7.1 or install GHC with Haddock
   in order to install Visual Haskell, make sure you have got a Visual Studio environment with latest Windows+VS service packs installed, run VSHaskell71.msi. VisualStudio2003.Net is known to work.
 
 make sure after installation there is no clashing Haskell path environment (ghc and other Haskell path environement variables are known to conflict with each other!)
   for GHC make sure the binary directory is in path, e.g. export PATH=C:\ghc\ghc-6.4.2\bin:$PATH

 make sure Haddock is in path, e.g. C:\Program Files\haddock-0.8

 system restart is required

 check GHC, Haddock both are in path from a console



 Install the Haskell http-module:

   1. Unpack the sources and enter the source directory. E.g.:
      $ tar -zxf http-VERSION.tar.gz
      $ cd http-VERSION
   2. Install the HTTP package:
         1. Configure:
            $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
         2. Compile:
            $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
         3. Install (as root):
            # runhaskell Setup.lhs install

 Install the Haskell HXT-module:
    install HXT 7.1 from 2nd February 2007 (later versions untested, but should also work):
  1. make setup
  2. setup configure --ghc
  3. setup build
  4. setup install		(# run as superuser)
  
 Build, link and test built HXT-libraries:
	cd examples
	make all
	make test
